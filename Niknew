1. Task Prioritization & Planning
Within the next 30 days, create a daily and weekly task plan highlighting critical tasks and expected completion dates. Review progress with the lead twice a week to ensure alignment.

2. Use of Automation & Tools
Identify at least two repetitive tasks in your current work that can be automated or optimized using existing tools/templates by the end of this month. Present proposed improvements to the team.

3. Cross-Team Communication
Provide status updates on tasks in the project tracker (e.g., JIRA) and via daily stand-up calls. Any blockers should be communicated within 2 working hours to avoid delays.

4. Time Management (Time-Boxing)
Implement a time-boxing approach for each major task, aiming to complete at least 80% of tasks within the estimated time frame over the next 45 days.
